#simple table of Justice40 disadvantaged communities vs. majority-minority communites
j40_disadvantaged = j40_race$definition_m_pctl
maj_min_communities = j40_race$majority_minority
outcomes = table(j40_disadvantaged, maj_min_communities)
outcomes
```

This tells us that of the 23,264 majority-minority census tracts in the data, Justice40 identifies 61.9% of them as disadvantaged.

Additionally, of the 22,543 disadvantaged communities identified by Justice40, 63.9% of them are majority-minority.
