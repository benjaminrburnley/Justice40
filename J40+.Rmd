mutate(white_pct = WhiteE/summary_est, 
       black_pct = BlackE/summary_est,
       native_pct = NativeE/summary_est,
       asian_pct = AsianE/summary_est,
       hipi_pct = HIPIE/summary_est,
       hispanic_pct = HispanicE/summary_est,
       majority_minority = if_else(white_pct < .50, 1, 0))
```

```{r}
#simple table of Justice40 disadvantaged communities vs. majority-minority communites

m_disadvantaged = j40_race$definition_m_pctl
maj_min_communities = j40_race$majority_minority
outcomes = table(m_disadvantaged, maj_min_communities)
outcomes
```

This tells us that of the 23,264 majority-minority census tracts in the data, Justice40 identifices 14,403 (61.9%) of them as disadvantaged.
